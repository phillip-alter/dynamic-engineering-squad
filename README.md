# Dynamic Engineering Squad
Refactoring the Future

## Vision Statement

This project is a gamified ASP.NET infrastructure reporting application defined by three core features: AI-driven damage analysis for cost estimation, a competitive community leaderboard, and a unique "naming rights" system that allows users to title and track specific hazards like local landmarks. The purpose of this platform is to transform passive residents into active infrastructure monitors, leveraging social accountability to motivate municipalities to prioritize repairs.  While competitors like SeeClickFix and standard 311 apps exist, they function as dry administrative intake forms; our application improves upon this by introducing identity and narrative—turning a generic ticket into a "community cause" - which drives significantly higher engagement and visibility than existing tools.
