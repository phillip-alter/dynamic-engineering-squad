# AI Supply Chain Transparency Explorer

## 1. Brainstorming Session (Mind Map Content)

This section captures the free-form brainstorming used to explore the maximum possible scope of the project. The goal of this exercise is breadth and depth rather than precision. Ideas range from practical to aspirational and are intended to be represented visually in a collaborative mind-mapping tool such as Miro.

### Central Topic

**AI Supply Chain Transparency Explorer**

---

### A. Core Problem Space (Why This Exists)

* Consumers lack visibility into where products actually come from
* Sustainability labels and certifications are confusing or inconsistent
* Greenwashing is common in marketing materials
* Global supply chains are intentionally opaque
* Environmental and social impact data is fragmented
* Ethical decision-making feels inaccessible or overwhelming
* People want to make better choices but lack understandable information

---

### B. Users / Stakeholders

* Everyday consumers
* Students learning sustainability concepts
* Educators and researchers
* Ethical and conscious shoppers
* Sustainability professionals (future expansion)
* NGOs and advocacy groups (future)
* Small businesses interested in transparency
* Policymakers (informational use only)

---

### C. User Entry Points

* Barcode scanning
* Product name search
* Brand search
* Category browsing (e.g., clothing, electronics, food)
* Side-by-side product comparison
* Exploration of data gaps and unknowns

---

### D. Data & Inputs (Acknowledging Imperfection)

* Public supply chain datasets
* Country- and region-level risk indices
* Industry averages
* Corporate sustainability and impact reports
* Certifications (e.g., Fair Trade, FSC)
* Optional user-provided context
* Historical sourcing patterns (e.g., typical origins of materials)

> Key idea: The system does not assume perfect or complete data and explicitly acknowledges uncertainty.

---

### E. Role of Artificial Intelligence

* Reasoning over incomplete and fragmented data
* Explaining uncertainty in clear, plain language
* Generating probabilistic supply chain pathways
* Translating technical sustainability concepts for non-experts
* Qualitative comparison of similar products
* Highlighting missing or unknown information
* Avoiding oversimplified single-score sustainability ratings

---

### F. Outputs to Users

* Plain-language explanations of likely supply chains
* Breakdown of supply chain stages:

  * Raw material extraction
  * Manufacturing
  * Assembly
  * Transportation
* Environmental risk indicators:

  * Water usage
  * Emissions
  * Biodiversity impact
* Social and labor risk indicators
* Confidence levels (high / medium / low)
* Suggestions for where improvements would have the greatest impact
* Comparison views between similar products
* Educational tooltips and contextual explanations

---

### G. Ethics & Transparency Considerations

* No false claims of certainty
* Clear disclosure of assumptions and limitations
* No user shaming or moral scoring
* Explicit explanation of uncertainty
* Use of publicly available and citable data sources
* Encouragement of systems thinking rather than perfectionism

---

### H. Stretch Goals / “Pie in the Sky” Ideas

* Browser extension integration
* Community-submitted insights or annotations
* Classroom or educational mode
* Brand response or transparency portal
* Integration with policy simulation tools
* Visualization of global material flows
* "Design a more sustainable version" feature

---

### I. Constraints and Boundaries

* Designed for a single academic term
* Reliance on public and non-proprietary data
* Informational tool only (no enforcement or certification claims)
* Focus on education, transparency, and awareness

---

## 2. Vision Statement

The **AI Supply Chain Transparency Explorer** is a web application that helps users understand the environmental and social impacts of everyday products by using artificial intelligence to reason over publicly available supply chain data and present it in clear, accessible language. The application enables users to search or scan products, view likely supply chain stages with associated environmental and labor risks, and compare similar products while transparently communicating uncertainty and data gaps. The purpose of this project is to empower consumers and students with systems-level insight into global supply chains without oversimplifying complex sustainability tradeoffs or relying on misleading single “eco scores.” This topic is proposed because existing sustainability tools often obscure assumptions, hide uncertainty, or require expert knowledge, limiting their trustworthiness and educational value. While applications such as Good On You, Ethical Consumer, and corporate sustainability dashboards already exist, they frequently rely on opaque scoring systems or proprietary data; this project remains valuable because it prioritizes explainability, transparency, and learning, making sustainability information more honest, interpretable, and accessible.
