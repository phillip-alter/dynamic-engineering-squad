        <h2>Purpose</h2>

        <p>
            InfrastructureApp helps community members report everyday infrastructure issues so the right people can
            see them and take action. The goal is to make it easier to share concerns like potholes, damaged signs,
            unsafe sidewalks, or other public-space problems while enjoying a new game.

            confusing and time-consuming. This app provides a simple place to submit reports and view helpful, high-level
            information about what has been reported.
