    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how the PatchNotes infrastructure application (“the application”)
        collects, uses, stores, and protects user information. This page is intended to clearly
        describe what data is collected, why it is collected, and what rights users have regarding
        their personal information.
    </p>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy is publicly accessible and does not require users to log in to view it.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
        The application collects only the information necessary to support its core functionality.
        Depending on how the application is used, collected data may include:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Name or display name</li>
        <li>Email address</li>
        <li>User-submitted form data (such as reports or feedback)</li>
        <li>Basic account information required for authentication</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Data is collected when users register for an account, submit forms, or interact with features
        that require identification. Some data is required to use core features of the application,
        while optional fields are clearly identified when applicable.
    </p>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>
        Collected data is used only for legitimate operational purposes related to the application,
        including:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Creating and managing user accounts</li>
        <li>Authenticating users</li>
        <li>Displaying submitted information within the application</li>
        <li>Supporting normal application operations</li>
        <li>Communicating with users regarding account or submission activity</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        User data is not used for advertising or marketing purposes.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>
        User data is stored in a secure database used by the application. Data may be hosted using
        cloud-based infrastructure services to support reliability and availability.
    </p>

    <p>
        Reasonable security practices are used to protect user data, including authentication
        controls, access restrictions, and secure communication methods. Specific technical
        implementation details are not publicly disclosed for security reasons.
    </p>

    <p>
        User data is retained only for as long as it is necessary to support application functionality
        or until a user requests deletion, subject to academic or operational requirements.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
        The application does not sell, rent, or trade user data.
    </p>

    <p>
        User data is not shared with third parties except in limited circumstances, such as when
        required to operate core application services or when legally required to do so. Any third-
        party services used are limited to infrastructure or hosting support and do not receive
        unnecessary personal information.
    </p>

    <h2>User Rights and Choices</h2>
    <p>
        Users have the right to:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Request access to their personal data</li>
        <li>Request corrections to inaccurate information</li>
        <li>Request deletion of their account and associated data, when applicable</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Requests related to privacy or data handling may be submitted using the contact options
        provided within the application.
    </p>

    <h2>Policy Updates</h2>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically to reflect changes in the application or data
        handling practices. The “Last Updated” date at the top of this page will reflect the most
        recent revision.
    </p>

    <p>
        Updates to this policy may be made without requiring changes to application functionality.
        Users are encouraged to review this page periodically to stay informed.
    </p>
