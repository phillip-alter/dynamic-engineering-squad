### Longed For
- Longed for more guidance and direction in development

## Exciting/Encouraging 
- Encouraged by the fact that the application runs and deploys
- Encouraged that working as a team works and functions
- Encouraged by the independence of each person
- Excited about applying these skills and tools to the real world

## Actions
- Manage personal time: having set boundaries and due dates from the maintainer has been helpful and should continue
- More git commits: Having more git commits can be helpful for preserving code and ensuring that people credit you for the amount of work you perform
- Work on things early: Commit to working on stuff early so the maintainer has more time to fix any issues with Azure
- Open communication: Talking among the group and communicating issues that we find with each other
- Utilize each other's strengths
